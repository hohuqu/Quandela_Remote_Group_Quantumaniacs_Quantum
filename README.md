## Problem Statement
In this challenge, our primary aim is to delve into the correlation between linear optical circuits, which can be represented as unitary operations on modes, and the resulting unitary operators on the Fock space. Additionally, we seek to explore strategies for designing more complex linear optical gates effectively.

To solve the challenge, we have harnessed the capabilities of Perceval, an open-source framework thoughtfully developed by Quandela. [Perceval](https://github.com/Quandela/Perceval) provides a comprehensive toolkit for working with photonic circuits, including:
* Constructing circuits with linear optical components.
* Precisely defining single-photon sources and associated error models.
* Manipulating Fock states to meet our specific needs.
* Conducting simulations to assess circuit behavior and performance.
* Exploring emerging quantum algorithms and their potential applications.

By leveraging Perceval, we aim to enhance our understanding of these intricate concepts and their practical applications within the realm of quantum optics and quantum information processing
