	abstract = {Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), an intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, have attracted widespread attention due to their potential advantages over classical analogs. However, in the current era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, it is essential to investigate whether QGANs can perform learning tasks on near-term quantum devices usually affected by noise and even defects. In this Letter, using a programmable silicon quantum photonic chip, we experimentally demonstrate the QGAN model in photonics for the first time, and investigate the effects of noise and defects on its performance. Our results show that QGANs can generate high-quality quantum data with a fidelity higher than 90{\textbackslash}\%, even under conditions where up to half of the generator's phase shifters are damaged, or all of the generator and discriminator's phase shifters are subjected to phase noise up to 0.04\${\textbackslash}pi\$. Our work sheds light on the feasibility of implementing QGANs on NISQ-era quantum hardware.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing aims at exploiting quantum phenomena to efficiently perform computations that are unfeasible even for the most powerful classical supercomputers. Among the promising technological approaches, photonic quantum computing offers the advantages of low decoherence, information processing with modest cryogenic requirements, and native integration with classical and quantum networks. To date, quantum computing demonstrations with light have implemented specific tasks with specialized hardware, notably Gaussian Boson Sampling which permitted quantum computational advantage to be reached. Here we report a first user-ready general-purpose quantum computing prototype based on single photons. The device comprises a high-efficiency quantum-dot single-photon source feeding a universal linear optical network on a reconfigurable chip for which hardware errors are compensated by a machine-learned transpilation process. Our full software stack allows remote control of the device to perform computations via logic gates or direct photonic operations. For gate-based computation we benchmark one-, two- and three-qubit gates with state-of-the art fidelities of \$99.6{\textbackslash}pm0.1 {\textbackslash}\%\$, \$93.8{\textbackslash}pm0.6 {\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$86{\textbackslash}pm1.2 {\textbackslash}\%\$ respectively. We also implement a variational quantum eigensolver, which we use to calculate the energy levels of the hydrogen molecule with high accuracy. For photon native computation, we implement a classifier algorithm using a \$3\$-photon-based quantum neural network and report a first \$6\$-photon Boson Sampling demonstration on a universal reconfigurable integrated circuit. Finally, we report on a first heralded 3-photon entanglement generation, a key milestone toward measurement-based quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to increase greatly the efficiency of solving problems such as factoring large integers, combinatorial optimization and quantum physics simulation. One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.},

	abstract = {Numerical optimization is used to design linear-optical devices that implement a desired quantum gate with perfect fidelity, while maximizing the success rate. For the two-qubit controlled-sign [or controlled NOT (CNOT)] gate, we provide numerical evidence that the maximum success rate is S=2/27 using two unentangled ancilla resources; interestingly, additional ancilla resources do not increase the success rate. For the three-qubit Toffoli gate, we show that perfect fidelity is obtained with only three unentangled ancilla photons—less than in any existing scheme—with a maximum S=0.003 40. This compares well to S=(2/27)2/2≈0.002 74, obtainable by combining two CNOT gates and a passive quantum filter [T. C. Ralph, K. J. Resch, and A. Gilchrist, Phys. Rev. A 75, 022313 (2007)]. The general optimization approach can easily be applied to other areas of interest, such as quantum error correction, cryptography, and metrology [M. M. Wilde and D. B. Uskov, Phys. Rev.

	abstract = {The simplest decomposition of a Toffoli gate acting on 3 qubits requires five 2-qubit gates. If we restrict ourselves to controlled-sign (or controlled-NOT) gates this number climbs to 6. We show that the number of controlled-sign gates required to implement a Toffoli gate can be reduced to just 3 if one of the three quantum systems has a third state that is accessible during the computation—i.e., is actually a qutrit. Such a requirement is not unreasonable or even atypical since we often artificially enforce a qubit structure on multilevel quantums systems (e.g., atoms, photonic polarization plus spatial modes). We explore the implementation of these techniques in optical quantum processing and show that linear optical circuits could operate with much higher probabilities of success.},

On the platform of linear optics, where two-qubit gates can only be achieved probabilistically, our method significantly reduces the amount of components and increases success probability of a two-qubit gate. The experimental implementation of our technique presented in this Letter for a controlled single-qubit unitary gate demonstrates that only one tunable controlled-phase gate is needed instead of two standard controlled-not gates. Thus, not only do we increase the success probability by about 1 order of magnitude (with the same resources), but also avoid the need for conducting quantum nondemolition measurement otherwise required to join two probabilistic gates. Subsequently, we generalize our method to a higher order, showing that n-times controlled gates can be optimized by replacing blocks of controlled-not gates with tunable controlled-phase gates.},
